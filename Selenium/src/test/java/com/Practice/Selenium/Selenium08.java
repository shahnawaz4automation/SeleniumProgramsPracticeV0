		 * ----> How Dynamic Dispatch Works?
		 * == Compile-Time: The compiler checks if the get() method exists in the WebDriver interface, and it does.
		 * The compiler doesnâ€™t know yet which specific version of get() will be executed. 
		 * 
		 * == Runtime: At runtime, the JVM knows that the object is of type EdgeDriver, so it calls the get() method of EdgeDriver, 
		 * not some other implementation.*/
